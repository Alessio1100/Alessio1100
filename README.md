### Hey 👋, I'm Alessio

I'm a **Computer Engineer** fascinated by the two sides of the digital coin: how to build intelligent systems and how to protect them.

My passion lies at the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Cybersecurity**, figuring out how machines "learn" and how to defend the infrastructure they run on.

⚡ **A Few Quick Facts**

* I'm actively exploring the world of **Machine Learning**, from predictive models to neural networks.
* I have a strong interest in **Cybersecurity**, especially in *network security* and *threat analysis*.
* Most of my experiments and projects are available here on [GitHub](https://github.com/Alessio1100).
* As Ellen Ullman said, "We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins." — and I enjoy exploring (and protecting) those "ruins".
